//Here is a difference between {{ }} and [ ]
//TODO: Study this, and understand why it happens, and when it's useful to rely on it when writing macros and expansions.
// It's an order of precedence thing. When it doesn't work, it's because [] is evaluated during the markdown of the entire
//      line, whereas the t="{{self.c}}" doesn't evaluate until the JIT attrs are marked down. Or so is my theory. Need to
//      verify by running in debugger, and looking at the line while it is being processed.
@var ENC="{{code.encode_smd(t=\"&nbsp;{{self.c}}\")}}" c="[smd_markdown_here]"
I expect to get **smd_markdown_here**, but instead I get *[ENC]*
@dump var="ENC"

@var ENC="[code.encode_smd(t=\"&nbsp;[self.c]\")]" c="[smd_markdown_here]"
So put [] around self.c to get **smd_markdown_here**, but instead I get *[ENC]*
@dump var="ENC"

@var ENC="[code.encode_smd(t=\"&nbsp;{{self.c}}\")]" c="[smd_markdown_here]"
So finally, I put the [] around the code.encode_smd, and {{}} around self.c, and I get *[ENC]*
@dump var="ENC"

***[ENC]***

Two different ways to do indented boxes
[bmgreybg._open]
[var.code.wc_open(t="High level overview of startup")]

Uses courier font and formatting

[var.code.wc_close]
[bmgreybg._close]



[bmgreybg._open]
[wrap_h(t="###High level overview of startup")]

... data here - uses standard font and formatting...

[bmgreybg._close]

var.terminal vs var.terminal2. Is one better over the other? Should I fix the output of terminal?

you can't use escape_var... if the variable has a {{code.pushlines}} in it. I think because it expands, not sure. It would be nice to figure out why this is, because several of the builtin code macros fail when attempting to use them with variables that use pushlines... Not just code.pushlines either. I think it has to do with get_value() in the namespace xface actually causing code to run??? figure it out!

[var.code.wc_open] does not work correctly. leaves open <code> tag...

If you are using any non-block elements as your current [smdwrap.b] tag, and you are using any of the **avshot** builtins, you need to reset the floating element CSS that is used by the **AV** div. In this example, I've set the [smdwrap.b] tag to [encode_tag(t="p")], so you can see what happens.

[smd.b] has a built keyword, two actually, that you can use to clear the floats and begin normal markdown. They are: [smdbreak.b] or [smdexit.b]. They do exactly the same thing, so it doesn't matter which one you use. Once you insert that command, the floats will be cleared, and you can continue with normal markdown.

I need to fix this once and for all. **p** needs to be the plain p with 1.2em size, so you have a better default. And then AV shot (and any other built-ins for shots), can be modified to use the "special p" that has the float right CSS associated.
