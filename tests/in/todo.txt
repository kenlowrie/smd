help track how to reorg the test scripts to make sure everything is covered.

break/exit - Upon completion of all the test script conversion and a user manual sweep, see if these are still used/required.
debug - dump.md DONE
divs - divs.md DONE (This is all the special divs. e.g. section, plain, note, code, review, syntax ...)
dump - dump.md DONE
header  - markdown.md DONE (and it's used in pretty much every script)
image - image.md DONE
mailto - mailto.md DONE (tests the encoded email addresses when a mailto: address is used.)
markdown - markdown.md DONE
raw - wrap.md DONE (used in lots of things)
revision - revision.md DONE (this specifically handles the revision with embedded date/time)
stop/quit - stop.md/quit.md DONE
wrap - wrap.md DONE

film - do side by side like image...


import  - import.md
embed   - import.md
watch   - import.md

var - variables.md
set - variables.md

code - code.md
link - links.md
html - script1, specials?, transitions?

## existing scripts - review and figure out what goes where, and what is covered.

misc
script1
specials
transitions

Final reviews after completing the test script rewrites ...
-----------------------------------------------------------

image - review and see what can be cleaned up with the kludges and macro usage throughout.
