help track how to reorg the test scripts to make sure everything is covered.

divs - divs.md DONE (This is all the special divs. e.g. section, plain, note, code, review, syntax ...)
markdown - markdown.md DONE
wrap - wrap.md DONE



revision - revision.md DONE (this specifically handles the revision with embedded date/time)
mailto: - mailto.md DONE (tests the encoded email addresses when a mailto: address is used.)

header  - markdown, most all scripts

import  - import.md
embed   - import.md
watch   - import.md

var - variables.md
set - variables.md

code - code.md

link - script1, ???
html - script1, specials?, transitions?

image - image.md

dump
- add filetracker="" and sysdefaults=""
- modify the debug and dump to remove objectids/threadids so they can be tested. [code.objects], debug[name.objectid]
- this needs to be configurable, because it's useful to have the ids, right?

debug - maybe in dump?
defaults - this can go away if I move this logic to @dump

break/exit
stop/quit

raw - wrap.md, others???

## existing scripts - review and figure out what goes where, and what is covered.

varv2 - move this code to variables and remove this
film - ???
image - ???
misc
script1
specials
transitions
