help track how to reorg the test scripts to make sure everything is covered.

break/exit - Upon completion of all the test script conversion and a user manual sweep, see if these are still used/required.
debug - dump.md DONE
divs - divs.md DONE (This is all the special divs. e.g. section, plain, note, code, review, syntax ...)
dump - dump.md DONE
embed   - import.md DONE
film - film.md DONE
header  - markdown.md DONE (and it's used in pretty much every script)
image - image.md DONE
import  - import.md DONE
mailto - mailto.md DONE (tests the encoded email addresses when a mailto: address is used.)
markdown - markdown.md DONE
misc - misc.md DONE (this needs to be reworked once I have final macros in place)
raw - wrap.md DONE (used in lots of things)
revision - revision.md DONE (this specifically handles the revision with embedded date/time)
script1 - script.md DONE (will need some additional cleanup once the avs macros are finalized, and @wrap tag1, tag2 is in place)
specials - specials.md DONE (essentially the test for revision(), cover() and contact())
stop/quit - stop.md/quit.md DONE
transitions - transitions.md DONE (this was a dedicated way of testing @break before, but no longer applicable. now it's just another avshot tester.)
watch   - import.md DONE
wrap - wrap.md DONE


var - variables.md
set - variables.md

code - code.md
link - links.md
html - html.md


Final reviews after completing the test script rewrites ...
-----------------------------------------------------------

image - review and see what can be cleaned up with the kludges and macro usage throughout.
film - uses same kludges as image. The @wrap tag1, tag2 support should help clean things up...
import - when the encode_smd macro is added to code.md, remove the redefine in here.
script1 - cleanup with @wrap tag1, tag2 and avs.md cleanup...
misc - this is essentially a "letter" type HTML document, but it is too complicated and inconsistent.
