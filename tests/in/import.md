The reasoning behind @importing it first is because you can only @import once, but you can @embed as many times as you want. However, once you @embed, it shows up on the list of "seen" files by the tracker, so @import will fail. I am not sure if I want to change that behavior, since technically, @embed code would not likely be a candidate for @importing anyway...
