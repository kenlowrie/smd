avshot ...

[docthis.close]


Let's see a quick example now. The next line will begin with an ***&#42;*** and then contain the text that describes the visual, and the line after that will contain the narration that goes with it.



## This will have to be moved to a "shots" doc

{:.bigandbold.green}Seems to me that an example that shows how you could use SMD to generate an A/V script would be useful, and would be a way for me to bring over all the film, shot, etc, markdown, put into a directory, such as import/avs or something.  Then, I could use isolate all of that into a shot-specific userguide, and leave this one for the main smd utility.[bb]Also, the formatting in the new doc looks different than the old version, need to run that down to make sure it was intentional.[bb]

[avshot.shot_with_desc(_s="WS:Sunrise", _d="\
    There&apos;s just something about a sunrise that gets the blood flowing...\
    And here&apos;s some additional narration.[bb]\
    and here is some additional shot notes.\
")]

// Seems like @break is essentially a way of doing a "clear:both" thru the use of a display:block element such as headers...
//@break Not really needed, because the avshot macro properly handles the closure...
//{:.extras}# --- This also works...

[var.note(t="When you want to force the document out of shot mode, use ***@break*** or ***@exit*** on an empty line. That will reset the floats which are controlling the AV formatting, and start a new section. See how the document leaves the narration mode of the prior shot, and starts this new block paragraph?")]
@break

**[at]break** [lt]--Use @break or @exit to close a shot DIV."

You can have as much narration as required, just keep writing, even starting new regular paragraphs. When you're done, start a new visual, or add any other block element, such as links, aliases, headers, divs, etc. To add another shot, just repeat the steps above, like this:

//TODO: This requires that we rework aws.md and eliminate avwrapper and avwrapper2 in favor of avshot. But avshot is also
// broken, in that it needs to rely on pushlines when using shot_only or shot_with_desc due to the @@ requirement...


[avshot.shot_with_desc(_s="CU:Coffee pot heating on wire rack of fire pit", _d="\
    There&apos;s nothing like waking up to the smell of coffee percolating in the outdoors.\
    ")]

If you have text you want included in the HTML document, but do not want it rendered by the browser, use the **{:.ignore}** class prefix. For example, on the next line, we'll write {:.ignore}You won't see this.[bb]
{:.ignore}You won't see this.
When you examine the HTML, you'll see the prior text wrapped in **[lt]p[gt]** tags, inside **[lt]div class="extras"[gt]** markup. However, it will not be rendered by the browser, unless you modify the CSS rule for the ignore class.
Lines that begin with a double forward slash [***//***] are treated as comments, and are discarded by AVScript. They will not appear in the HTML at all. As another example, we'll write *//This will not appear in the HTML* on the next line.
//This will not appear in the HTML
If you examine the HTML output, you will not see the previous line in the output.

//TODO: This needs to be defined in the builtins
