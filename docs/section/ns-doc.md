[link.namespaces]
[wrap_h.chapter(t="## Namespaces")]

In [smd.b], one of the primary types of markdown (specially formatted text) that you can use is the **variable**. There are several types of variables that are supported, and they are referred to as namespaces within [smd.b]. They are:

[ulist.wc_open]
[E.at]var - The primary namespace for creating variables
[E.at]html - A namespace for creating HTML tags
[E.at]link - A namespace built on @html, that is for creating hyperlinks and anchors (bookmarks)
[E.at]image - Another HTML-based namespace, specifically for creating HTML Image [e_tag.b(t="img")] elements
[E.at]code - A specialized namespace for creating complex macros (written in Python)
[ulist.wc_close]

In the chapters that follow, we will take an indepth look at each namespace to learn it's specific syntax and semantics.
