Originally, production was planned for August 2018, but it has been delayed until September due to scheduling conflicts of both cast and crew. We are anticipating two to three (1/2) days for production as follows:

[var.scene.wc_open(t="Scene 3 EXT")]
    Cast: [mom], [daughter], [son][bb]Info: One (1) production day, evening shoot, *call time **5pm**, wrap time **8pm***.
[var.scene.wc_close]

[var.scene.with_content(t="Scene 1 EXT & Scene 2 INT" \
    c="Cast: [mom], [daughter][bb]Info: 1/2 Production day, *call time **8a**, wrap time **12pm** (noon)*")]

[var.scene.with_content("Scene 4 INT & Scene 5 EXT" \
    c="Cast: [mom][bb]Info: 1/2 Production day, *call time **3p**, wrap time **8p***. This could be scheduled the same day as Scenes 1 and 2 if the actor is available and prefers this option (longer day)" \

**NOTE:** Actual shoot days will be scheduled according to cast availability
