In this example, we will use [smd.b]'s **avshot** builtin to create an Audio/Visual (A/V) Script. AV Scripts are simple two column scripts that describe the visuals (i.e. shots) on the left, and the audio (i.e. narration or voiceover), on the right. [smd.b] has several builtins that assist with creating this type of script, but in this example, we are going to focus on **avshot**.

Start by including **[encode_smd(t="@import <sys.imports>")]/avs/avshot.md**, and you will get everything you need to use **avshot**.

**[encode_smd(t="<avshot.visual>")]** begins the definition of a shot. You can list one or more shots in this section, and include formatting and other markdown. When you are done listing the shots, you will use either **[encode_smd(t="<avshot.audio>")]** or **[encode_smd(t="<avshot.noaudio>")]** to either begin listing the narration or voiceover, or simply close out the shot. 

In this example, we will open with **avshot.visual**, write out shot description, and the close with **avshot.noaudio**, so there won't be anything listed in the right column.

[var.avshot.visual]

[var.avshot.noaudio]

Not too exciting just yet, but we'll get there. The more common case is to use **avshot.visual**, then describe the shot, use **avshot.audio**, describe the narration or voiceover, then close with **avshot.end**. Let's do that now, and see how it looks.

[var.avshot.visual]

    [ws] Busy freeway rush hour traffic at a standstill

[var.avshot.audio]
    In this example, after the preceding shot declaration, we used **[encode_smd(t="<avshot.audio>")]** to close out the visuals section, and begin the narrative section. You can have as much narration and notes as you need. When you're done, close out the shot with **[encode_smd(t="<avshot.end>")]**.

    There are a bunch of useful shot notation mnemonics defined in the **sys.imports/avs/shotacro.md** file, so you'll definitely want to review that to get an idea of those goodies!

[var.avshot.end]

[plain(t="Mixing AV Script builtins and other markdown")]

At any time in your AV Script, you can switch back and forth between shots and normal markdown. All you do is place the normal markdown outside the **avshot** builtins. It's that simple. When you're ready, you just start adding more shots!

    If you indent a line following a shot, then that text becomes part of the prior shot, allowing you to put a little more description if you need it.
[var.avshot.audio]
    If you want to put inline notes, questions or use any of the Simple Divs (*note, question, vo, important, greyout*), you need to use the ***no-div** version. The **no-div** version uses the suffix **_nd** on the key attribute names. For example, if I use the default and write:[bb] **[encode_smd(t="<note")][E.lp]t="this is my note")]**, this is what I will see:
    [var.note(t="this is my note")]
    See how the box jams up against the left margin of the right column? It also clears the floats, which will mess up the formatting for the next element in the audio section... ugh! 

    This time, i'll write **note.nd**, to use the no-div variant, and let's see how that looks:
    [note.nd]
    Much better! Just remember to use the **nd** versions of any of the simple divs when you are using them inside the **avshot** builtins!

[plain(t="Specialized avshot builtins")]
There are two short versions of avshot that can be used for quick shot only cases or shot with short description. They are:

[tab.<]**[encode_smd(t="<avshot.shot_only>")]** and **[encode_smd(t="<avshot.shot_with_desc>")]**[tab.>]

They are just simplified versions you can use to quickly generate a shot only or a shot with short description.

[terminal2.wc_open(t="Simplified *avshot* methods")]
    *[smdcomment.il] If all you have is a shot (visual), use the shot_only method*
    [encode_smd(t="<avshot.shot_only")](_s="shot info"[E.rp]]
    *[smdcomment.il] If you have a shot (visual) and audio (narration,...), use the shot_with_desc method*
    [encode_smd(t="<avshot.shot_with_desc")](_s="shot info" _d="shot description"[E.rp]]
    *[smdcomment.il] An example of each method*
    [E.lb]var.avshot.shot_only(_s="[E.lb]cu[E.rb] Hands holding phone")[E.rb]
    [E.lb]var.avshot.shot_with_desc(_s="[E.lb]ecu[E.rb] text message on phone" _d="help[E.lb]bb[E.rb]me")[E.rb]
[terminal2.wc_close]

And here is how the two **avshot** methods above will render:

[var.avshot.shot_only(_s="[cu] Hands holding phone")]

[var.avshot.shot_with_desc(_s="[ecu] text message on phone" _d="help[bb]me")]

Sometimes all you need are these shorthand methods to describe your shots, but in other cases the separate section-based methods (**avshot.visual**, **avshot.audio**, **avshot.end** are better. The good news, you can mix and match as you like. Before we leave this example, let's review the builtin hep string for **avshot**.

Okay, that wraps up this chapter on creating A/V scripts with [smd.b].
