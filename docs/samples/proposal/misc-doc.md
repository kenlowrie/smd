In this example, we will use [smd.b] to create a project proposal document. The objective here is simply to show that you can format content in all sorts of different ways using [smd.b], not that this example is necessarily the best way to create a project proposal. A regular old word processor would likely be a better option for this task...

{:.blue.center}# [thisproject] Project

The purpose of this document is to provide an estimate for the production and post production costs associated with producing the documentary tentatively titled *Just Shut It Off*."

{:.green}## Production Estimate
[plain(t="This estimate *does NOT* include costs for:")]
[olist.wc_tag_open]
    Stock footage (photos, video, audio, graphix, score, etc.) Producer will be responsible for purchasing clips to be used in the film. In the most common case, we will locate clips and provide purchasing details (costs, source, licensing info). The Producer will either purchase them directly and provide the footage to the editor, or we will send an invoice, and once it's paid in full, we will purchase the clips. Keep in mind that most sites have a **no refunds, no returns policy**. So once they are purchased, you own them.

    Shooting new footage. Any footage that we need to shoot will be invoiced separately. As is the case with stock footage, an invoice will be issued for footage we are to shoot, and it must be paid in advance before we will shoot it.

    Creation of custom graphics or animations.

    Foley creation

    Voiceover

    DVD and/or Blu-ray Mastering
[olist.wc_tag_close]

[plain(t="This estimate **does** include costs for:")]
[olist.wc_tag_open]
    Color correction

    Color grading

    If we already have (own) stock footage that can be used in the film, we are happy to use it. No additional costs will be associated with using the footage that we already own, but any copyrights on said footage remain with us.[dblbrk]

    Audio mixing (including FX, VO, score)[dblbrk]

    Music score (provided you choose a title from our existing royalty free library)[dblbrk]

    Mastering to high resolution H.264 digital media. Most festivals accept submissions in this format nowadays; also, this format can be remastered to either DVD or Blu-ray.

[plain(t="Cost options")]

Normally, there are three (3) billing options to choose from when hiring [Cloudy Logic Studios] to edit your film:

1. [e_us(t="**Per runtime minute of film**")]. $525/minute. Minimum charge: $2,625 (5 minute minimum, regardless if final film is less than 5 minutes long).

[note.wc_open]
    Example: If the **TRT** (total run time) of the finished film is eight (8) minutes, the total cost would be $4,200. Partial minutes will be billed in fifteen (15) second increments, i.e. ~$131 per one quarter (1/4) minute.[bb]
    {:.indent2}**Considerations when choosing TRT option**[bb]
    {:.indent2}This rate applies to editing normal footage (video, photos, audio). As an example, the demo film that we produced would have all fit under this rate, with one exception (green screen footage that was keyed for ending). However, if we are given footage that requires *specialized attention*, a different rate will apply on a per clip basis.[bb]
    {:.indent2}Some examples that require specialized attention are: Footage that is shot on green screen and must be keyed. Footage that is shaky and must be stabilized. Footage shot with incorrect color temperature. Any media (video/photos) that requires rotoscoping. Audio that must be cleaned up.
[note.wc_close]

2. [e_us(t="**Per hour**")]. Editing for this project will be billed at $60/hr. Since we bill based upon hours spent, there are no exceptions to the type of footage being edited, as is the case with the ***"Per runtime minute of film"*** estimate above.

3. [e_us(t="**Per project**")]. An estimate for the entire project requires a completed script in AV format, with all details ironed out, including exact clips to be used, footage to be shot, etc. Given those requirements, it is not feasible to provide this option for consideration at this time.

***NOTE:** For this project, only billing options 1 and 2 will be offered.*

[plain.with_content(t="Retainer", c="If you decide to hire [Cloudy Logic Studios] for this project, no retainer will be required.")]

[plain(t="Invoicing")]

Once the project is underway, we will invoice periodically as various milestones are met. These milestones will be set and agreed upon by both parties prior to commencement. They will be something like this:

[olist.wc_tag_open]
    Rough cut *- might be in stages*
    Picture lock *- no changes to timeline after this*
    Color grade complete *- possible after audio mixing*
    Audio mixing complete *- possible before color grade*
    Film completion
[olist.wc_tag_close]

[note.wc_open]
    If the project is being billed per runtime minute, the milestone invoices will be billed in fractional estimates of the minimum runtime up until picture lock, at which time remaining invoices will be billed based on the actual total runtime.[bb]

    If the project is being billed per hour, then invoices at each milestone will reflect the total based on hours invested to achieve the milestone.[bb]

    Usually, work on the next milestone will not commence until the invoice for the prior milestone has been paid.[bb]

    Finally, keep in mind that final media will not be released until all invoices are paid in full.
