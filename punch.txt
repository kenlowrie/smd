Punch List Items.
-----------------

1. Remove alias support. ability to [var]=value. You must use @var id="_" attr="x"
2. Remove bookmark support, unless I can think of how it could be used (for hyperlinks within the current doc, right?)
3. Remove all the CSS that relates to A/V scripts
4. Remove all special code relating to A/V scripts
5. Figure out how to implement the outer HTML Tag support
6. Figure out how to implement the <head></head> support
7. Implement the @embed support for inlining HTML, script, content, etc, without processing. [done]
8. Document the @embed "filename" support.
9. Inline links and Reference links do not work. I think it's because you have to use @link to define links... Fix the docs.
10. Mailto links and Automatic links also do not seem to work. Fix the docs.
11. Link aliases don't work. Fix the docs.
12. Bookmark syntax is wrong. Fix the docs.
13. Cover, Revision & Contact are wrong. Fix the docs.
14. Import: can I address the $ side effect? Perhaps with -d|--tld <top_level_path> for when stdin is used as top level?
15. Is varv2 a think? Fix the docs. I think it is basic. and var., where basic. refers to aliases, and var refers to @var ...








1. Finish up livesmd.py and release
4. Move all of these things to the issues tracker in github, and get rid of this file.

Bugs/Fixes Needed
-----------------
Look to see if I can make further improvements with speed. Cut down 40% of the calls
to markdown by only calling _md with lines that request the "marked_down" line...
Use python -m profile debug.py (debug.py loads and runs avscript -f ...)

Need ability to display error messages on ambiguous variable names.
@debug on="ns.add". Might need to spruce it up a bit. If you specify
a namespace, should this be okay? Because we rely on this for image.name
and var.name, as a way to create linked shots... 

Is the raw I have implemented any good? Or should I make it so it's done
in the namespaces module with an optional parameter, and then use @code
macros to access any element in raw form?

Remove unused code in .core module

Minor annoyance when dumping debug messages, during shots, the formatting
is getting messed up. Most likely due to somewhere we are not escaping HTML
output (maybe markdown, but that gets sketchy, so maybe not fixable)...

Things to test:

Rainy Day Fixes/Changes:

Parenthesis inside a variable string doesn't parse correctly
For now, the solution is to use html entities (&lpar; and &rpar;)
e.g. [var.section(t="Scene 15 - Location S3:42 L:~8s (Ending Instrumental)")]

Fix bug where ' inside a string [var.attr(a="this doesnâ€™t work")]
--workaround use &apos;

Can I change the HTML formatting from before hand to on the backend, when I actually output?
That would enable me to more readily detect unbalanced tags
And I could format the output so it's nice and easy to read.
