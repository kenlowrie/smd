### Script Markdown Processor

Welcome to the Script Markdown Processor. This document should help you get the project up and running. If you have questions, or would like to provide feedback and/or to report a bug, feel free to contact the author, Ken Lowrie, at [www.kenlowrie.com](http://www.kenlowrie.com/).

### Attributions

This project was originally inspired by John Gruber's [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the [Python Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown) Project, and Mark Boszko's [AVScriptFormat](https://github.com/bobtiki/AVScriptFormat) BBEdit plug-in. That resulted in [avscript](https://github.com/kenlowrie/avscript), the predecessor to **smd**.

#### Installing this app on your system

To install this on your system, do the following from a terminal window (after cloning it to your local system):

```
cd root_of_cloned_repo
pip install .
```

That's it! If you run into any problems, feel free to contact me for assistance.

#### Why Script Markdown Processor?

I wanted a way to dynamically create pages for use in OBS Studio, and this seemed like a good starting point to leverage other code I had.

#### Getting Started with the App

I don't think this app requires much documentation. But again, I will write up some additional basic information after I finish fixing a few more bugs and testing it out on different devices and browsers.

//TODO Need to update the userdocs.md once I get a good baseline.

User documentation is available via the "userdocs.md" file, which relies on the import file import/userguideheading.md.


#### Summary

This concludes the documentation on the Script Markdown (smd) Processor.
